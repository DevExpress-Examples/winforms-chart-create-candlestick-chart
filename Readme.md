# How to create a Candlestick chart


<p>The following example demonstrates how to create a <a href="http://devexpress.com/Help/Content.aspx?help=XtraCharts&document=CustomDocument2988.htm">Candlestick</a> chart at runtime.</p><p>Note that this series view type is associated with the <a href="http://devexpress.com/Help/Content.aspx?help=XtraCharts&document=CustomDocument5908.htm">XY-Diagram</a> type, and you should cast your <a href="http://devexpress.com/Help/Content.aspx?help=XtraCharts&document=CustomDocument6017.htm">diagram</a> object to this type, in order to access its specific options.</p><p>Also, note that starting from the v2010 vol 2 version, you can exclude non-working days (weekends and holidays) from an axis range, via the <strong>WorkdaysOnly</strong> and <strong>WorkdaysOptions</strong> properties. For details on this, refer to <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E2365">How to exclude weekends and holidays from the axis range</a>.</p>
